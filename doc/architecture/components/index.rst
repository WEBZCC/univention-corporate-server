In this part of the document, you dive into the second, medium, detail level of
the architecture of Univention Corporate Server (UCS). You learn about UCS
product components that you face directly when you use UCS. The product
components typically act as entry points for your tasks.

The description of the product components is for administrators and solution
architects. For software developers and system engineers it provides the context
for the architectural dive-in to UCS. Make sure you are familiar with the
:ref:`concepts` behind UCS.

The following product components introduce themselves in the order you will most
likely encounter them when you work with UCS:

#. :ref:`component-portal`
