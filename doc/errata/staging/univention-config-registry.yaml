desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The Python-API of Univention Config Registry has been extended to
   offer a method `get_int()`, that can be used to avoid receiving a
   string, when an integer is required. If the value of the requested
   UCR variable is not a number, the default value is returned
   verbatim instead.
