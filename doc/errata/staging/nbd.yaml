fix: 1:3.19-3+deb10u1
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * In nbd-server in nbd before 3.24, there is an integer overflow with a
   resultant heap-based buffer overflow. A value of 0xffffffff in the name
   length field will cause a zero-sized buffer to be allocated for the name,
   resulting in a write to a dangling pointer. This issue exists for the
   NBD_OPT_INFO, NBD_OPT_GO, and NBD_OPT_EXPORT_NAME messages.
   (CVE-2022-26495)
 * In nbd-server in nbd before 3.24, there is a stack-based buffer overflow.
   An attacker can cause a buffer overflow in the parsing of the name field by
   sending a crafted NBD_OPT_INFO or NBD_OPT_GO message with an large value as
   the length of the name. (CVE-2022-26496)
