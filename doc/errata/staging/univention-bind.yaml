desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The UCR variable dns/timeout-start is now also considered
   in the systemd unit univention-bind-ldap. This can be used
   in cases where a large number of DNS zones slows down the
   start of the DNS server bind. This only affects systems
   which have dns/backend set to "ldap". i.e. systems that
   are not configured as Samba/AD DC.
