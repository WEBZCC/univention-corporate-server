 This update addresses the following issues:
 * `univention-run-diagnostic-checks` now offers to run a group of tests and
   also to exclude some of the tests.
 * A diagnostic module has been added to check the UCR variable
   `notifier/protocol/version`.
 * The Python 3 compatibility when handling exceptions in certain diagnostic
   plugins has been corrected.
 * The system diagnosis in UMC will not check the available for ISO images
   anymore, which previously lead to thrown warnings.
