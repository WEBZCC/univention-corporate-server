desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A NULL pointer dereference was discovered in ifilter_bank of
   libfaad/filtbank.c in Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 (FAAD2) 2.8.8. The
   vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application crash, which
   leads to denial of service because adding to windowed output is mishandled
   in the ONLY_LONG_SEQUENCE case. (CVE-2018-20199)
 * An invalid memory address dereference was discovered in the
   sbr_process_channel function of libfaad/sbr_dec.c in Freeware Advanced
   Audio Decoder 2 (FAAD2) 2.8.8. The vulnerability causes a segmentation
   fault and application crash, which leads to denial of service.
   (CVE-2018-20360)
 * An issue was discovered in Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 (FAAD2) 2.8.8.
   It is a buffer over-read in ps_mix_phase in libfaad/ps_dec.c.
   (CVE-2019-6956)
 * An issue was discovered in faad2 through 2.10.0. A heap-buffer-overflow
   exists in the function sbr_qmf_synthesis_64 located in sbr_qmf.c. It allows
   an attacker to cause code Execution. (CVE-2021-32274)
 * An issue was discovered in faad2 through 2.10.0. A NULL pointer dereference
   exists in the function get_sample() located in output.c. It allows an
   attacker to cause Denial of Service. (CVE-2021-32276)
 * An issue was discovered in faad2 through 2.10.0. A heap-buffer-overflow
   exists in the function sbr_qmf_analysis_32 located in sbr_qmf.c. It allows
   an attacker to cause code Execution. (CVE-2021-32277)
 * An issue was discovered in faad2 through 2.10.0. A heap-buffer-overflow
   exists in the function lt_prediction located in lt_predict.c. It allows an
   attacker to cause code Execution. (CVE-2021-32278)
