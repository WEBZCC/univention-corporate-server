fix: 2.8.0~cvs20161113-1+deb9u3
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A NULL pointer dereference was discovered in `ifilter_bank()` of
   libfaad/filtbank.c. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and
   application crash, which leads to denial of service because adding to
   windowed output is mishandled in the ONLY_LONG_SEQUENCE case.
   (CVE-2018-20199)
 * An invalid memory address dereference was discovered in the function
   `sbr_process_channel()` of libfaad/sbr_dec.c. The vulnerability causes a
   segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to denial of service.
   (CVE-2018-20360)
 * A buffer over-read in `ps_mix_phase()` in libfaad/ps_dec.c was discovered.
   (CVE-2019-6956)
 * A heap-buffer-overflow exists in the function `sbr_qmf_synthesis_64()`
   located in sbr_qmf.c. It allows an attacker to cause code Execution.
   (CVE-2021-32274)
 * A NULL pointer dereference exists in the function `get_sample()` located in
   output.c. It allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service.
   (CVE-2021-32276)
 * A heap-buffer-overflow exists in the function `sbr_qmf_analysis_32()`
   located in sbr_qmf.c. It allows an attacker to cause code Execution.
   (CVE-2021-32277)
 * A heap-buffer-overflow exists in the function `lt_prediction()` located in
   lt_predict.c. It allows an attacker to cause code Execution.
