fix: 1:13.14.1~dfsg-2+deb9u6
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source through 13.27.0, 14.x and
   15.x through 15.7.2, and 16.x through 16.4.0, and Certified Asterisk
   through 13.21-cert3. A pointer dereference in chan_sip while handling SDP
   negotiation allows an attacker to crash Asterisk when handling an SDP
   answer to an outgoing T.38 re-invite. To exploit this vulnerability an
   attacker must cause the chan_sip module to send a T.38 re-invite request to
   them. Upon receipt, the attacker must send an SDP answer containing both a
   T.38 UDPTL stream and another media stream containing only a codec (which
   is not permitted according to the chan_sip configuration). (CVE-2019-13161)
 * An issue was discovered in manager.c in Sangoma Asterisk through 13.x,
   16.x, 17.x and Certified Asterisk 13.21 through 13.21-cert4. A remote
   authenticated Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) user without system
   authorization could use a specially crafted Originate AMI request to
   execute arbitrary system commands. (CVE-2019-18610)
 * An issue was discovered in channels/chan_sip.c in Sangoma Asterisk 13.x
   before 13.29.2, 16.x before 16.6.2, and 17.x before 17.0.1, and Certified
   Asterisk 13.21 before cert5. A SIP request can be sent to Asterisk that can
   change a SIP peer's IP address. A REGISTER does not need to occur, and
   calls can be hijacked as a result. The only thing that needs to be known is
   the peer's name; authentication details such as passwords do not need to be
   known. This vulnerability is only exploitable when the nat option is set to
   the default, or auto_force_rport. (CVE-2019-18790)
 * An issue was discovered in res_pjsip_t38.c in Sangoma Asterisk through 13.x
   and Certified Asterisk through 13.21-x. If it receives a re-invite
   initiating T.38 faxing and has a port of 0 and no c line in the SDP, a NULL
   pointer dereference and crash will occur. This is different from
   CVE-2019-18940. (CVE-2019-18976)
 * An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.x before 13.37.1, 16.x
   before 16.14.1, 17.x before 17.8.1, and 18.x before 18.0.1 and Certified
   Asterisk before 16.8-cert5. If Asterisk is challenged on an outbound INVITE
   and the nonce is changed in each response, Asterisk will continually send
   INVITEs in a loop. This causes Asterisk to consume more and more memory
   since the transaction will never terminate (even if the call is hung up),
   ultimately leading to a restart or shutdown of Asterisk. Outbound
   authentication must be configured on the endpoint for this to occur.
