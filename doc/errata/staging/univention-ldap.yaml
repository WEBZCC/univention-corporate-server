desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * A new LDAP attribute has been introduced with 5.0-1 errata100.
   As reindexing is time consuming the decision was made to release
   the updated indexing with 5.0-2 and not via errata updates.
   Therefore, a manual fix for customers has been published. Visit

   for a detailed guide of this manual fix.
