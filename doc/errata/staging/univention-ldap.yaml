desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * A new LDAP attribute has been introduced with 5.0-1 erratum 100. As
   re-indexing is time consuming the decision was made to delay the indexing
   until 5.0-2 and not to do it via n errata update. Therefore, a manual fix
   for customers is available and the required steps are documented at
   <http://help.univention.com/t/19248>.
