desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * A new UCR variable `ldap/translog-ignore-temporary` has been created
   to control if UDM temporary objects should be considered for replication
   by the OpenLDAP `translog` overlay which feeds the Listener/Notifier.
   This reduces the number of replication transactions during creation of
   users and groups significantly. As a result it increases the replication
   performance and reduces the rate at which the cn=translog LMDB backend
   database gets filled.
   This variable is applicable only to the UCS Primary Directory Node.
   By default is will be set to "yes" during package instllation and update.
