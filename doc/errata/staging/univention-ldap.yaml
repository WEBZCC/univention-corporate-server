desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * A new UCR variable `ldap/translog-ignore-temporary` has been created to
   control if UDM temporary objects should be considered for replication by
   the OpenLDAP `translog` overlay which feeds the Listener/Notifier. This
   reduces the number of replication transactions during creation of users and
   groups significantly. As a result it increases the replication performance
   and reduces the rate at which the LMDB backend database `cn=translog` gets
   filled.
   This variable is applicable only to the UCS Primary Directory Node.
   By default is will be set to `yes` during package installation and update.
