desc: |-
  This update addresses the following issues:
  * A new UCR variable "ldap/translog-ignore-temporary" has been created
   to control if UDM temporary objects should be considered for replication
   by the Listener/Notifier mechanism. This variable is applicable only to the
   UCS Primary Directory Node. For new installations the default is "yes"
   For updated UCS systems it will not be activated autoamtically.
