 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The notifier aborts if the transaction ID issued by the OpenLDAP translog
   overlay is not a valid integer.
 * Restarting the systemd unit is limited to 50 times in an observation window
   of 1000s.
 * The script `univention-translog` recognizes the special values "<TransID>"
   and "0" and is able to fix them.
 * The script `univention-translog` also check the file
   "listener/listener.priv" if it exists.
 * Improved log messages of `univention-translog`.
