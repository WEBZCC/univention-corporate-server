desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Disallow SSL renegotiation more completely; SSL renegotiation has been
   disabled for some time, but the server would still cooperate with a
   client-initiated renegotiation request. A maliciously crafted renegotiation
   request could result in a server crash (see OpenSSL issue CVE-2021-3449).
   Disable the feature altogether on OpenSSL versions that permit doing so.
