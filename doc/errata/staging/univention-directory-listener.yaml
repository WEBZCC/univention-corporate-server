desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The notifier should abort if the transaction ID issued by the OpenLDAP translog overlay is not a valid integer
 * The systemd unit should not be restarted forever. The number of automated restarts is now limited to 50 in an
   observation window of 1000s
 * The script univention-translog should also check the "listener/listener.priv" file if it exists
