 This update addresses the following issues:
 * PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
   C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP,
   STUN, TURN, and ICE. In PJSIP before version 2.11.1, there are a couple of
   issues found in the SSL socket. First, a race condition between callback
   and destroy, due to the accepted socket having no group lock. Second, the
   SSL socket parent/listener may get destroyed during handshake. Both issues
   were reported to happen intermittently in heavy load TLS connections. They
   cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service. These are fixed in version
   2.11.1. (CVE-2021-32686)
 * PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
   C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP,
   STUN, TURN, and ICE. In affected versions if the incoming STUN message
   contains an ERROR-CODE attribute, the header length is not checked before
   performing a subtraction operation, potentially resulting in an integer
   underflow scenario. This issue affects all users that use STUN. A malicious
   actor located within the victim’s network may forge and send a specially
   crafted UDP (STUN) message that could remotely execute arbitrary code on
   the victim’s machine. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.
   There are no known workarounds. (CVE-2021-37706)
 * PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
   the C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP,
   STUN, TURN, and ICE. In various parts of PJSIP, when error/failure occurs,
   it is found that the function returns without releasing the currently held
   locks. This could result in a system deadlock, which cause a denial of
   service for the users. No release has yet been made which contains the
   linked fix commit. All versions up to an including 2.11.1 are affected.
   Users may need to manually apply the patch. (CVE-2021-41141)
 * Stack overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_player_create. An
   attacker-controlled 'filename' argument may cause a buffer overflow since
   it is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without any size validation.
   (CVE-2021-43299)
 * Stack overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_recorder_create. An
   attacker-controlled 'filename' argument may cause a buffer overflow since
   it is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without any size validation.
   (CVE-2021-43300)
 * Stack overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_playlist_create. An
   attacker-controlled 'file_names' argument may cause a buffer overflow since
   it is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without any size validation.
   (CVE-2021-43301)
 * Read out-of-bounds in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_recorder_create. An
   attacker-controlled 'filename' argument may cause an out-of-bounds read
   when the filename is shorter than 4 characters. (CVE-2021-43302)
 * Buffer overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_call_dump. An
   attacker-controlled 'buffer' argument may cause a buffer overflow, since
   supplying an output buffer smaller than 128 characters may overflow the
   output buffer, regardless of the 'maxlen' argument supplied
   (CVE-2021-43303)
 * PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
   C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP,
   STUN, TURN, and ICE. In affected versions if the incoming RTCP BYE message
   contains a reason's length, this declared length is not checked against the
   actual received packet size, potentially resulting in an out-of-bound read
   access. This issue affects all users that use PJMEDIA and RTCP. A malicious
   actor can send a RTCP BYE message with an invalid reason length. Users are
   advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds.
   (CVE-2021-43804)
 * PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library. In
   version 2.11.1 and prior, if incoming RTCP XR message contain block, the
   data field is not checked against the received packet size, potentially
   resulting in an out-of-bound read access. This affects all users that use
   PJMEDIA and RTCP XR. A malicious actor can send a RTCP XR message with an
   invalid packet size. (CVE-2021-43845)
 * PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
   C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP,
   STUN, TURN, and ICE. In version 2.11.1 and prior, there are various cases
   where it is possible that certain incoming RTP/RTCP packets can potentially
   cause out-of-bound read access. This issue affects all users that use
   PJMEDIA and accept incoming RTP/RTCP. A patch is available as a commit in
   the `master` branch. There are no known workarounds. (CVE-2022-21722)
 * PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
   C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP,
   STUN, TURN, and ICE. In versions 2.11.1 and prior, parsing an incoming SIP
   message that contains a malformed multipart can potentially cause
   out-of-bound read access. This issue affects all PJSIP users that accept
   SIP multipart. The patch is available as commit in the `master` branch.
   There are no known workarounds. (CVE-2022-21723)
 * PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
   C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP,
   STUN, TURN, and ICE. In versions up to and including 2.11.1 when in a
   dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by multiple UAC dialogs
   can potentially be prematurely freed when one of the dialogs is destroyed .
   The issue may cause a dialog set to be registered in the hash table
   multiple times (with different hash keys) leading to undefined behavior
   such as dialog list collision which eventually leading to endless loop. A
   patch is available in commit db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f which
   will be included in the next release. There are no known workarounds for
   this issue. (CVE-2022-23608)
 * PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
   C language. In versions prior to and including 2.12 PJSIP there is a
   stack-buffer overflow vulnerability which only impacts PJSIP users who
   accept hashed digest credentials (credentials with data_type
   `PJSIP_CRED_DATA_DIGEST`). This issue has been patched in the master branch
   of the PJSIP repository and will be included with the next release. Users
   unable to upgrade need to check that the hashed digest data length must be
   equal to `PJSIP_MD5STRLEN` before passing to PJSIP. (CVE-2022-24754)
 * PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in
   C. Versions 2.12 and prior contain a stack buffer overflow vulnerability
   that affects PJSUA2 users or users that call the API `pjmedia_sdp_print(),
   pjmedia_sdp_media_print()`. Applications that do not use PJSUA2 and do not
   directly call `pjmedia_sdp_print()` or `pjmedia_sdp_media_print()` should
   not be affected. A patch is available on the `master` branch of the
   `pjsip/pjproject` GitHub repository. There are currently no known
   workarounds. (CVE-2022-24764)
