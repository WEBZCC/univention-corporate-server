desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * When user templates were members of groups an error was raised
   which prevented opening or modifying that group. Templates as
   group members are now ignored in UDM module `groups/group`.
 * Moving of `users/ldap` objects is possible again. This was broken
   due to the Python 3 migration in UCS 5.0.
 * Solved an issue that could appear on multithreaded enviroments
   due to reading over a shared resource.
