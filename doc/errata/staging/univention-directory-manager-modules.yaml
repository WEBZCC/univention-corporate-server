fix: 15.0.11-33A~5.0.0.202203101146
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * When user templates were members of groups an error was raised
   which prevented opening or modifying that group. Templates as
   group members are now ignored in UDM module `groups/group`.
 * Moving of `users/ldap` objects is possible again. This was broken
   due to the Python 3 migration in UCS 5.0.
 * Two resource sharing conflicts on Python dictionaries have been
   fixed, that could lead to tracebacks when modules are reloaded
   in a multithreaded context.
 * It is now possible to search for the user expiry date of `users/user`
   objects.
 * Searching with patterns containing umlauts is possible again.
 * When removing a policy the policy is removed from the referencing objects.
 * Byte values are now correctly decoded for the labels of choices delivered
   by the syntax class `LDAP_Search`.
