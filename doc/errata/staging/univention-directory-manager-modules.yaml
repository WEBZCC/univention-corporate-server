desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * ucs_registerLDAPExtension from the Univention shell function library
   now allows the option umcmessagecatalog. This option can be used to
   supply translation files in GNU message catalog format for the UMC.
 * The simple UDM API now exposes the "remove_childs" option of UDMs
   remove() function in the delete() method, to recursively delete
   objects below the DN of the object that is being deleted.
