 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Buffer Overflow vulnerability exists in FFmpeg 4.1 via
   apng_do_inverse_blend in libavcodec/pngenc.c, which could let a remote
   malicious user cause a Denial of Service (CVE-2020-21041)
 * Buffer Overflow vulnerability in FFmpeg 4.2 in mov_write_video_tag due to
   the out of bounds in libavformat/movenc.c, which could let a remote
   malicious user obtain sensitive information, cause a Denial of Service, or
   execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2020-22015)
 * A heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in FFmpeg 4.2 at
   libavcodec/get_bits.h when writing .mov files, which might lead to memory
   corruption and other potential consequences. (CVE-2020-22016)
 * Buffer Overflow vulnerability in FFmpeg 4.2 in the build_diff_map function
   in libavfilter/vf_fieldmatch.c, which could let a remote malicious user
   cause a Denial of Service. (CVE-2020-22020)
 * Buffer Overflow vulnerability in FFmpeg 4.2 at filter_edges function in
   libavfilter/vf_yadif.c, which could let a remote malicious user cause a
   Denial of Service. (CVE-2020-22021)
 * A heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability exists in FFmpeg 4.2 in
   filter_frame at libavfilter/vf_fieldorder.c, which might lead to memory
   corruption and other potential consequences. (CVE-2020-22022)
 * A heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerabililty exists in FFmpeg 4.2 in
   filter_frame at libavfilter/vf_bitplanenoise.c, which might lead to memory
   corruption and other potential consequences. (CVE-2020-22023)
 * A heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability exists in gaussian_blur at
   libavfilter/vf_edgedetect.c, which might lead to memory corruption and
   other potential consequences. (CVE-2020-22025)
 * Buffer Overflow vulnerability exists in FFmpeg 4.2 in the config_input
   function at libavfilter/af_tremolo.c, which could let a remote malicious
   user cause a Denial of Service. (CVE-2020-22026)
 * Buffer Overflow vulnerability exists in FFmpeg 4.2 in filter_vertically_8
   at libavfilter/vf_avgblur.c, which could cause a remote Denial of Service.
   (CVE-2020-22028)
 * A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability exists in FFmpeg 4.2 at
   libavfilter/vf_w3fdif.c in filter16_complex_low, which might lead to memory
   corruption and other potential consequences. (CVE-2020-22031)
 * A heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability exists FFmpeg 4.2 at
   libavfilter/vf_edgedetect.c in gaussian_blur, which might lead to memory
   corruption and other potential consequences. (CVE-2020-22032)
 * A heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability exists in FFmpeg 4.2 in
   filter_intra at libavfilter/vf_bwdif.c, which might lead to memory
   corruption and other potential consequences. (CVE-2020-22036)
 * Prior to ffmpeg version 4.3, the tty demuxer did not have a 'read_probe'
   function assigned to it. By crafting a legitimate "ffconcat" file that
   references an image, followed by a file the triggers the tty demuxer, the
   contents of the second file will be copied into the output file verbatim
   (as long as the `-vcodec copy` option is passed to ffmpeg). (CVE-2021-3566)
 * libavcodec/dnxhddec.c in FFmpeg 4.4 does not check the return value of the
   init_vlc function, a similar issue to CVE-2013-0868. (CVE-2021-38114)
