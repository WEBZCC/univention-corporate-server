desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * By crafting a malicious CSTATE, it is possible to trick the server into
   returning more bytes than the buffer actually holds, resulting in leaking
   arbitrary heap data. (CVE-2019-8921)
 * Heap-based buffer overflow exists in `service_attr_req()` for SDP protocol
   handling (CVE-2019-8922)
 * Memory leak in the SDP protocol (CVE-2021-41229)
