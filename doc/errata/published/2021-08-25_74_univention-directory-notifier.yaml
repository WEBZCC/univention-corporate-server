desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The notifier aborts if the transaction ID issued by the OpenLDAP translog
   overlay is not a valid integer.
 * Restarting the systemd unit is now limited to 50 times in an observation
   window of 1000 seconds.
 * The script `univention-translog` recognizes the special values "<TransID>"
   and "0" and is able to fix them.
 * The script `univention-translog` now also checks the file
   "listener/listener.priv" if that exists.
 * Log messages of `univention-translog` have been improved.
