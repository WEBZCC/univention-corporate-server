fix: 0.7.git20120829-3.1~deb9u2
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * An exploitable denial of service vulnerability exists in the atftpd daemon.
   A specially crafted sequence of RRQ-Multicast requests trigger an
   `assert()` call resulting in denial-of-service. An attacker can send a
   sequence of malicious packets to trigger this vulnerability.
   (CVE-2020-6097)
 * tftpd_file.c has a buffer overflow because buffer-size handling does not
   properly consider the combination of data, OACK, and other options.
