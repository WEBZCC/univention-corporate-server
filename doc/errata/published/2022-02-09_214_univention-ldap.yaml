desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A new LDAP attribute has been introduced with 5.0-1 erratum 100. As
   re-indexing is time consuming the decision was made to delay the indexing
   until 5.0-2 and not to do it via an errata update. Therefore, a manual fix
   for customers is available and the required steps are documented at
   <http://help.univention.com/t/19248>.
 * A new UCR variable `ldap/translog-ignore-temporary` has been created
   to control if UDM temporary objects should be considered for replication
   by the OpenLDAP `translog` overlay which feeds the Listener/Notifier.
   This reduces the number of replication transactions during creation of
   users and groups significantly. As a result it increases the replication
   performance and reduces the rate at which the cn=translog LMDB backend
   database gets filled.
   This variable is applicable only to the UCS Primary Directory Node.
   By default is will be set to "yes" during package instllation and update.
 * The french translation of UDM extended attributes has been updated.
 * URL's, configuration file strings and regular expressions are now
   correctly escaped in the `slapd.conf` configuration file.
