 This update addresses the following issues:
 * When a specially crafted NTFS attribute is supplied to the function
   `ntfs_get_attribute_value()`, a heap buffer overflow can occur allowing for
   memory disclosure or denial of service. The vulnerability is caused by an
   out-of-bound buffer access which can be triggered by mounting a crafted
   NTFS partition. The root cause is a missing consistency check after reading
   an MFT record : the `bytes_in_use` field should be less than the
   `bytes_allocated` field. When it is not, the parsing of the records
   proceeds into the wild. (CVE-2021-33285)
 * When a specially crafted unicode string is supplied in an NTFS image a heap
   buffer overflow can occur and allow for code execution. (CVE-2021-33286)
 * When specially crafted NTFS attributes are read in the function
   `ntfs_attr_pread_i()`, a heap buffer overflow can occur and allow for
   writing to arbitrary memory or denial of service of the application.
   (CVE-2021-33287)
 * When a specially crafted MFT section is supplied in an NTFS image a heap
   buffer overflow can occur and allow for code execution. (CVE-2021-33289)
 * When a specially crafted NTFS inode pathname is supplied in an NTFS image a
   heap buffer overflow can occur resulting in memory disclosure, denial of
   service and even code execution. (CVE-2021-35266)
 * A stack buffer overflow can occur when correcting differences in the MFT
   and MFTMirror allowing for code execution or escalation of privileges when
   setuid-root. (CVE-2021-35267)
 * When a specially crafted NTFS inode is loaded in the function
   `ntfs_inode_real_open()`, a heap buffer overflow can occur allowing for
   code execution and escalation of privileges. (CVE-2021-35268)
 * When a specially crafted NTFS attribute from the MFT is setup in the
   function `ntfs_attr_setup_flag()`, a heap buffer overflow can occur
   allowing for code execution and escalation of privileges. (CVE-2021-35269)
 * A crafted NTFS image can cause a NULL pointer dereference in
   `ntfs_extent_inode_open()`. (CVE-2021-39251)
 * A crafted NTFS image can cause an out-of-bounds read in `ntfs_ie_lookup()`.
   (CVE-2021-39252)
 * A crafted NTFS image can cause an out-of-bounds read in
   `ntfs_runlists_merge_i()`. (CVE-2021-39253)
 * A crafted NTFS image can cause an integer overflow in `memmove()`, leading
   to a heap-based buffer overflow in the function
   `ntfs_attr_record_resize()`. (CVE-2021-39254)
 * A crafted NTFS image can trigger an out-of-bounds read, caused by an
   invalid attribute in `ntfs_attr_find_in_attrdef()`. (CVE-2021-39255)
 * A crafted NTFS image can cause a heap-based buffer overflow in
   `ntfs_inode_lookup_by_name()`. (CVE-2021-39256)
 * A crafted NTFS image with an unallocated bitmap can lead to a endless
   recursive function call chain starting from `ntfs_attr_pwrite()`, causing
   stack consumption. (CVE-2021-39257)
 * A crafted NTFS image can cause out-of-bounds reads in `ntfs_attr_find()`
   and `ntfs_external_attr_find()`. (CVE-2021-39258)
 * A crafted NTFS image can cause out-of-bounds reads in `ntfs_attr_find()`
   and `ntfs_external_attr_find()`. (CVE-2021-39259)
 * A crafted NTFS image can cause an out-of-bounds access in
   `ntfs_inode_sync_standard_information()`. (CVE-2021-39260)
 * A crafted NTFS image can cause a heap-based buffer overflow in
   `ntfs_compressed_pwrite()`. (CVE-2021-39261)
 * A crafted NTFS image can cause an out-of-bounds access in
   `ntfs_decompress()`. (CVE-2021-39262)
 * A crafted NTFS image can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by an
   unsanitized attribute in `ntfs_get_attribute_value()`. (CVE-2021-39263)
