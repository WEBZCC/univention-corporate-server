			It provides several feature improvements and extensions, new properties as well as various improvements and bugfixes.
			Here is an overview of the most important changes:

		<title>Notes about the update</title>
		<para>
			Prerequisite for updating is at least UCS <productnumber>4.4-8</productnumber> with <u:erratum release="4.4-8">972</u:erratum>.
			Only then the available update will be shown.
			Is is recommended to install all other pending errata too before the update is started.
		</para>
		<para>
			If the update is started via &ucsUMC;:
			Before the actual update starts, some tests are performed, e.g. if all installed Apps would be available on UCS <productnumber>5.0</productnumber>.
			At this point, the web interface is already in maintenance mode and nothing is shown but a progress bar.
			If one test fails, the update will be canceled and a message is written to <filename>/var/log/univention/updater.log</filename>.
			To read these in the web frontend, log in to &ucsUMC;, open the <guimenu>Software update</guimenu> module and click on "View log file".
		</para>
		<para>
			During the update some services in the domain may not be available temporarily, that is why the update should occur in a maintenance window.
			It is recommended to test the update in a separate test environment prior to the actual update.
			The test environment should be identical to the production environment.
			Depending on the system performance, network connection and the installed software the update will take between 20 minutes and several hours.
			In large environments it may be useful to consult the <biblioref linkend="ucs-performance-guide"/>.

				The authoritative version of the LDAP directory service is maintained on the &ucsPrimaryDN; (formerly referred to as &ucsMaster;) and replicated to all the remaining LDAP servers of the UCS domain.
				As changes to the LDAP schema can occur during release updates, the &ucsPrimaryDN; must always be the first system to be updated during a release update.

		<section id="relnotes:tls">
			<title>Increased minimal TLS protocol version</title>
			<para>
				In the area of cryptography the minimal TLS protocol version has been raised to 1.2.
				For <literal>OpenSSL</literal> this is enforced by the parameter <literal>MinProtocol</literal> in <filename>/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf</filename>.
				As a consequence, TLS connections to external systems should be checked for TLS 1.2 support before updating to UCS 5.0, as they are likely to fail after the update.
				This affects AD-Connector setups synchronizing UCS with Microsoft Server versions older than <literal>2012R2</literal>, if they are configured to use an encrypted connection.
				Additionally the OpenSSL default <literal>CipherString</literal> configuration is <literal>DEFAULT@SECLEVEL=2</literal> in UCS 5.0.
				This additionally restricts the available ciphers for communication, which rules out <literal>SHA1</literal> in particular.
				E.g. Windows Server 2012 supports less ciphers that Windows Server 2012R2 by default.

			<title>Notes about default master packages</title>
			<para>
				Apps like <application>UCC</application> and <application>Open-Xchange</application> used to install special packages on &ucsPrimaryDN; and &ucsBackupDN; to extend the LDAP server with schema and ACL rules.
				These packages are not needed anymore, these extensions are now distributed via &ucsUDL;.
				The packages should be removed before the upgrade is started to avoid incompatibilities with Python 3.
				Packages that are known to be incompatible are: <package>univention-corporate-client-schema</package>, <package>univention-ox-dependencies-master</package> and <package>univention-ox-directory-integration</package>.
				The system will also be checked for incompatible package as a preparation for the upgrade, see also <xref linkend="relnotes:prepare"/>.

		<title>Simultaneous operation of UCS and Debian on UEFI systems</title>
		<para>
			Please note that simultaneous operation of UCS and Debian on a UEFI system starting with UCS 5.0-1 is not supported.
		</para>
		<para>
			The reason for this is the GRUB boot loader of &ucsUCS;, which partly uses the same configuration files as Debian.
			An already installed Debian leads to the fact that UCS cannot be booted (any more) after the installation of or an update to UCS 5.0.
			A subsequent installation of Debian will also result in UCS 5.0 not being able to boot.

		<title>Local package repository</title>

		<para>
			This section is relevant for environments where a <ulink url="https://docs.software-univention.de/handbuch-5.0.html#software::createrepo">local repository</ulink> is set up.
			The installed (major) version of UCS determines which packages a local repository provides.
			A repository running on a UCS server with version 4.x will only provide packages up to UCS 4.x, a repository server running on UCS 5 will only provide packages for UCS 5 and newer versions.
			To upgrade systems to UCS 5 in an environment with a local repository, the following are some of the options.
			First, a local UCS 5 repository server must be set up.
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						A new UCS 5 system is installed as a &ucsPrimaryDN; from the DVD or from a virtualized base image.
						Then <ulink url="https://docs.software-univention.de/handbuch-5.0.html#software::createrepo">a local repository is set up on this system as described in the UCS 5 manual</ulink>.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						A new UCS 5 system is installed with the system role &ucsBackupDN;, &ucsReplicaDN; or &ucsManagedNode; from the DVD or from a virtualized base image.
						In system setup, select that the system will not join a domain.
						Then <ulink url="https://docs.software-univention.de/handbuch-5.0.html#software::createrepo">set up a local repository on this system as described in the UCS 5 manual</ulink>.
						After the &ucsPrimaryDN; used in the domain is upgraded to UCS 5, the UCS 5 repository server can join the domain via <command>univention-join</command>.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			To upgrade a system in the domain to UCS 5, the server should first be upgraded to the latest package level available for UCS 4.x.
			Then the repository server used by the system is switched to the local UCS 5 repository by changing the &ucsUCRV; <envar>repository/online/server</envar>.
			The system can now be upgraded to UCS 5 via the &ucsUMC; or via the command line.

	<chapter id="relnotes:prepare">
		<title>Preparation of update</title>

		<para>
			Manually crafted Python code needs to be checked for compatibility with Python 3.7 before the Update and adjusted accordingly.
			This includes &ucsUCR; templates containing Python code.
			Customized AD-Connector mapping templates are an example for this.
			See also the <biblioref linkend="developer-reference"/> for advice.
		</para>
		<para>
			It must be checked whether sufficient disk space is available.
			A standard installation requires a minimum of 6-10 GB of disk space.
			The update requires approximately 1-2 GB additional disk space to download and install the packages, depending on the size of the existing installation.
		</para>

		<para>
			For the update, a login should be performed on the system's local console as user <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>, and the update should be initiated there.
			Alternatively, the update can be conducted using &ucsUMC;.
		</para>

		<para>
			Remote updating via SSH is not recommended as this may result in the update procedure being canceled, e.g., if the network connection is interrupted.
			In consequence, this can affect the system severely.
			If updating should occur over a network connection nevertheless, it must be verified that the update continues in case of disconnection from the network.
			This can be achieved, e.g., using the tools <command>tmux</command>, <command>screen</command> and <command>at</command>.
			These tools are installed on all UCS system roles by default.
		</para>

		<para>
			Univention provides a script that checks for problems which would prevent the successful update of the system.
			Prior to the update, this script can be downloaded and executed on the UCS system.

				This logging is only performed when the <emphasis>UCS Core Edition</emphasis> license is used.
				The license status can be verified via the menu entry <guimenu>License &ar; License information</guimenu> of the user menu in the upper right corner of &ucsUMC;.
				If <guimenu>UCS Core Edition</guimenu> is listed under <guimenu>License type</guimenu>, this version is in use.
