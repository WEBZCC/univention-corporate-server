Let's Encrypt
=============

Let's Encrypt is a non-profit certificate authority that provides X.509
certificates for TLS encryption at no charge. It is the world's largest
certificate authority with the goal of all websites being secure and using
HTTPS.

The Let's Encrypt app in Univention App Center offers a largely automated
integration of the acme-tiny Let's Encrypt client in UCS. The supported services
in UCS are the Apache Webserver, the Postfix SMTP mailserver and the Dovecot
IMAP mailserver.
