Trust relationships
===================

Trust relationships between domains make it possible for users from one
domain to log on to computers from another domain.

In general, Windows trust relations can be unidirectional or
bidirectional. Technically a bidirectional trust is simply realized as
two unidirectional trusts, one in each direction.

The terminology of unidirectional trusts depends on the perspective of
either the trusting or trusted domain: From the perspective of the
trusting domain, the trust is called *outgoing*.
From the perspective of the trusted domain, the trust is called
*incoming*.

In UCS, outgoing trust (UCS trusts Windows) is not supported currently.
As a consequence, bidirectional trust is not supported either.

When setting up and using the trust relationship the domain controllers
of both domains must be able to reach each other over the network and
identify each other via DNS. At least the fully qualified DNS names of
the domain controllers of the respective remote domain must be
resolvable to allow communication between both domains to work. This can
be achieved by configuring conditional DNS forwarding in both domains.

The following example assumes, that the UCS Samba/AD DC |UCSPRIMARYDN|
``primary.ucsdom.example``
has the IP address ``192.0.2.10`` and that the Active Directory
domain controller ``dc1.addom.example`` of the remote domain
has the IP address ``192.0.2.20``.

On the UCS side the conditional forwarding of DNS queries can be set up
as ``root`` with the following
commands:

.. code-block:: console

   cat >>/etc/bind/local.conf.samba4 <<__CONF__
   zone "addom.example" {
     type forward;
     forwarders { 192.0.2.20; };
   };
   __CONF__
   systemctl restart bind9



The success can be checked by running :command:`host
dc1.addom.example`.

In addition, it may be useful to create a static entry for the domain
controller of the remote Active Directory domain in the file
:file:`/etc/hosts`:

.. code-block:: console

   ucr set hosts/static/192.0.2.20=dc1.addom.example


On a Windows AD DC, a so-called *conditional
forwarding* can be set up for the UCS domain via the DNS
server console.

After this preliminary work, the trust itself can be established
directly from the command line of the UCS Samba/AD DC.

Trust relationships can only be configured on domain controllers but
they affect the whole domain.

In Samba/AD domain the trust relationship can be configured easily on
the command line using the tool :command:`samba-tool`:

.. code-block:: console

   samba-tool domain trust create addom.example \
              -k no -UADDOM\\Administrator%ADAdminPassword \
              --type=external --direction=incoming


The trust can be checked using the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

   samba-tool domain trust list
   wbinfo --ping-dc –domain=addom.example
   wbinfo --check-secret –domain=addom.example


After the setup, a UCS user should be able to log on to systems of the
remote Active Directory domain. Users must either use the format
``UCSDOM\username`` as login
name or their Kerberos principal in the notation ``username@ucsdom.example``.
