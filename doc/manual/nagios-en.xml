	<title>Infrastructure monitoring</title>
		<para>
			UCS offers two different solutions for infrastructure monitoring. On the one hand the UCS Dashboard helps administrators
			to quickly read the state of domains and individual servers. On the other hand, under UCS 4.4, with Nagios it is possible to
			continuously check computers and services in the background and proactively trigger a notification if a warning level is
			reached. With UCS 5.0 support for the Nagios server component has been discontinued, but the systems can still be
			monitored, e.g. by UCS 4.4 Nagios servers, as described in the UCS 4.4 manual.
		</para>

		<section id="dashboard::general">
			<title>UCS Dashboard</title>
				<para>
					The UCS Dashboard app allows administrators to view the state of the domain and individual
					servers can be read quickly and clearly on so-called dashboards. The dashboards are
					accessible via a Web browser, access a database in the background, and deliver
					continuously updated reports on specific aspects of the domain or server.
				</para>

			<section id="dashboard::installation">
				<title>Installation</title>
				<para>
					The UCS Dashboard consists of three parts:
				</para>
					<itemizedlist>

								The UCS Dashboard Client app for deploying the metrics of

						</listitem>
					</itemizedlist>
				<para>
					The app <emphasis>UCS Dashboard</emphasis> can be installed from the Univention App Center on a
					server in the domain. Currently, the installation is only possible on the system roles
					Primary, Backup or &ucsReplicaDN;.
					The apps <emphasis>UCS Dashboard Database</emphasis> and <emphasis>UCS Dashboard Client</emphasis>
					are automatically installed on the same system.
				</para>
				<para>
					The app <emphasis>UCS Dashboard Client</emphasis> should be installed on every UCS system.
					Only then will the system data be displayed on the dashboard.
				</para>
			</section>

			<section id="dashboard::usage">
				<title>Usage</title>
				<para>
					After the installation, the UCS Dashboard is linked in the portal.
					Alternatively, it can be accessed directly via <uri>https://SERVERNAME-OR-IP/ucs-dashboard/</uri>.
				</para>
				<para>
					By default access is only granted to users of the
					group <systemitem class="groupname">Domain Admins</systemitem> (e.g. the user Administrator).
					<!--It is also possible to set the circle of the logon authorized persons to
					expand.-->
				</para>
				<section id="dashboard::use:domain">
					<title>Domain dashboard</title>
						<figure id="dashboard-domain">
							<title>Domain dashboard</title>
							<graphic scalefit="1" width="80%" align="center" fileref="illustrations50/dashboard-domain.png"/>
						</figure>
					<para>
						After the login, the Domain dashboard is opened by default. On this
						dashboard, general information about the domain is displayed, such as
						how many servers and how many users exist in the environment.
					</para>
					<para>
						Furthermore, the UCS systems are listed on the dashboard, in a tabular overview, including
						further information, such as the server role, the installed apps or whether an update is
						available or not.
					</para>
					<para>
						In addition, the CPU usage, memory usage, free hard disk space and
						the status of the LDAP replication are displayed.
						In this graphics all servers are displayed together.
					</para>

				<section id="dashboard::nutzung:server">

						<figure id="dashboard-server">
							<title>Server dashboard</title>
							<graphic scalefit="1" width="80%" align="center" fileref="illustrations50/dashboard-server.png"/>
						</figure>
					<para>
						By default, the server dashboard is also configured. On this dashboard,
						detailed information about individual server systems are shown, such as the CPU- or
						memory usage or network throughput.
					</para>
					<para>
						The servers can be selected in the dropdown <guimenu>server</guimenu>. Then the
						graphics show the details about the selected server.
					</para>
				</section>
				<section id="dashboard::usage:mydashboard">
					<title>Own dashboards</title>
					<para>
						The two included dashboards <emphasis>domain dashboard</emphasis> and <emphasis>server
						dashboard</emphasis> can't be changed, because they are updated by Univention with updates.
					</para>
					<para>
						Instead, you can create your own dashboards. On these dashboards you can then either add already
						existing elements or new elements can be created. All you need to do is
						click on the plus sign on the left side. A new dashboard will be created
						which can be filled with elements.
