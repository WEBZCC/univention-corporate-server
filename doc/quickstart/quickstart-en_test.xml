	Univention Corporate Server (UCS) is a server operating system based
	on Debian GNU/Linux with integrated management system for the
	central administration of servers, services, clients, desktops and
	users.
  </para>
  <para>
	This quickstart guide offers a short introduction on how to get
	started with UCS. Several features of UCS are only mentioned briefly
	with a reference to further documentation. The documentation on UCS
	is available at
	<link xlink:href="https://docs.software-univention.de/">https://docs.software-univention.de/</link>.

	The installation DVD can be downloaded from the Univention website
	at
	<link xlink:href="https://www.univention.com/downloads/ucs-download/iso-installation-image/">https://www.univention.com/downloads/ucs-download/iso-installation-image/</link>.
	The installation DVD is only available for the host architecture
	amd64 (64-bit). It has support for the Unified Extensible Firmware
	Interface-Standard (UEFI) including SecureBoot.
  </para>
  <para>
	Alternatively preinstalled images for VMware and VirtualBox can be
	used. These are available for download at

	The system requirements vary considerably depending on the intended
	purpose and the number of users. The minimum requirements for the
	installation are 1 GB memory and 8 GB hard drive space.
  </para>

<section xml:id="quickstart:installation">
  <title>Installation</title>
  <para>
	The installation is performed via a menu-driven installer and can be
	used both interactively and completely profile-based .
  </para>
  <para>
	The system language, keyboard layout and time zone can be selected
	in accordance with local requirements.
  </para>
  <para>
	A valid network configuration should be set during the installation.
	If, for example, a gateway and a name server are specified, but the
	name server cannot be reached, this may result in unnecessary
	timeouts. In these cases, it makes more sense not to specify a
	gateway. The network configuration can be employed using DHCP. If
	there is already a name server available in the local network, it
	should be used. If additional UCS systems are installed in the
	domain at a later point in time, the UCSPRIMARYDN and any
	UCSBACKUPDN systems should be entered as name servers.
  </para>
  <para>
	During installation, the system can be used for various purposes
	which can only be configured at this point in the setup process.
  </para>
  <itemizedlist spacing="compact">

		The system is to be the first system in a new UCS domain and it

		The system can be joined into an existing Active Directory

  </para>
  <para>
	With UCS and the Active Directory Takeover an existing Active
	Directory domain can be migrated completely to UCS. For information
	on how to set up the UCS system for this scenario, see .
  </para>
  <para>
	In the subsequent course of the installation, the fully qualified
	host name, under which the computer should be accessible in the
	network, is entered for a UCSPRIMARYDN. A local name should also be
	used as the domain name in this case, e.g., company.intranet. (If
	the system is used as a mail server, for example, the mail domains
	can be used independently of the domain names). For example, to
	commission the mailserver host system in the company.intranet DNS
	domain, mailserver.company.intranet should be entered as the fully
	qualified host name. The LDAP base is suggested based on the fully
	qualified host name and only needs to be adjusted in exceptional
	cases. For all other systems roles it is normally sufficient to
	enter the host name only. The domain name will we fetched from the
	UCSPRIMARYDN when the domain is joined. The root password must be at
	least eight characters long and is also set as the password for the
	user <emphasis>Administrator</emphasis> during the installation of
	the first UCS system (UCSPRIMARYDN).
  </para>
  <para>
	An autopartitioning feature can be used during the installation
	which creates an LVM volume group on the first hard drive by
	default.
  </para>
  <para>
	The installed software components can be adapted later at any time
	and subsequently installed from the Univention App Center.
  </para>
  <para>
	After confirming the configuration settings the installation is
	initiated. Once completed, the system must be restarted. The further
	configuration is made using the UCSUMC (UMC). This is described in
	more detail in the following chapter.
  </para>

<section xml:id="quickstart:administration">
  <title>UCS web interface</title>
  <para>
	The web interface of an installed UCS system is directly available
	via its IP address (<link xlink:href="https://">https://</link> or
	<link xlink:href="http://">http://</link>, HTTPS is recommended). By
	default, a portal page is configured on the UCSPRIMARYDN where all
	applications are listed that are installed in the domain. For all
	other system roles, the start site consists of an overview of all
	locally installed applications. (View as well as the partitioning of
	entries can be customized in a very flexible manner, see also .)
  </para>
  <para>
	On each start site of a UCS system, there is an entry System and
	domain settings in the section Administration (or System settings,
	respectively) that points to the UCSUMC (UMC) of the local system.
	UCSUMC is the central tool for web-based administration of a UCS
	domain. There are different modules available on the UCS system
	depending on the installation and system role selected. The login to
	UCSUMC is performed as user Administrator with the password
	specified for the user root during the installation.
  </para>
  <para>
	For administrating UCS, the LDAP directory is the central component
	of a UCS domain. In the LDAP, domain wide information such as the
	users, groups and computer accounts is saved. Depending on the
	settings, this information is replicated to the other Directory
	Nodes in the domain either completely or selectively. The UMC
	modules which edit the LDAP directory directly can be accessed only
	on the UCSPRIMARYDN via UCSUMC. Furthermore, they can also be
	controlled using the command line interface UCSUDM .

  <title>Configuration management using Univention Configuration
  Registry</title>
  <para>
	Univention Configuration Registry is the central tool for managing
	the local system configuration of a UCS system. Settings are
	specified in a consistent format, the so-called Univention
	Configuration Registry variables. These variables are used to
	generate the configuration files used effectively by the
	services/programs. Direct editing of the configuration files is only
	needed in exceptional cases.
  </para>
  <para>
	UCSUCR variables are managed via the UCSUMC module Univention
	Configuration Registry. Configuration files are automatically
	updated when the UCR variables registered on them are changed.
